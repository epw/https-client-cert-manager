When you need to generate a new server key (say, for the once-a-year
rotation), use ./create-server-ca.sh

When you need to create a new client key, use ./create-client-cert.sh

When you need to protect a directory, create a .htaccess file in the
directory with "SSLVerifyClient require"

The user is the environment variable $SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_CN
