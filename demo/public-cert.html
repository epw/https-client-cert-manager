    <h1>Client Certs - Public Example</h1>
    <p>
      This is an implementation of the system at <a target="_blank"
      href="https://github.com/epw/https-client-cert-manager">https://github.com/epw/https-client-cert-manager</a>. This
      page is provided to try out the system. It will let you generate
      a real client certificate for this Web server. Since it is just
      a testing server, all you will really be able to do with this
      certificate is generate more certificates, but that should let
      you explore what it is like to use them across different devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Normally, you would probably want some other method of vetting
      users and knowing who they are, so that you can assign them
      meaningful names. As it is, this will simply generate a random
      10-letter string as a name. This even means that there is a tiny
      (26<sup>-10</sup>) chance that your name will be the same as
      someone else's, and so, even though you will have different
      public keys, this server's standard identification software will
      confuse you. Again, a real server implementing this system
      should be smarter.

      If you're ready to download a certificate, then <form
      action="safe-generate.cgi" method="POST"><button>Click
      here</button></form>
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, you will be able to access <a
      href="https://eric-cert.willisson.org/certs/">https://eric-cert.willisson.org/certs/</a>,
      and use it to generate new certs.
